The current project I am working on for The Odin Project is the HTML Recipes section. For the most part, all the HTML information until this point has been kind of like a refresher course in the sense that I taught myself a lot of this when I was around 14 or so. That knowledge has of course become fuzzy over the years due to a lack of practice. Theoretically though, what this project should help me to attain is a refreshed knowledge of the basics of HTML and how I can use that to create a basic website. It seems likely that I'll be using standard elements such as lists, both ordered and unordered, images, and different text styling.
