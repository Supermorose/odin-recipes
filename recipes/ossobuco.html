        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Ossobuco, is a Milanese specialty of veal shanks cooked in meat broth and flavored with white wine.</p>
        <p>Slowly braised, this relatively tough, yet flavorful cut of meat becomes meltingly tender, and the connective tissues and marrow dissolve into the sauce, making it rich and creamy.</p>
        <p>Veal shanks are a relatively cheap cut of meat which are readily available in most good supermarkets and butcher shops. Look for meaty hind-shanks cut from the top of the thigh with a high proportion of meat to bone. Each piece should be about five inches across and one-inch to one-and-a-half inches thick.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Slices of veal hind shank</li>
            <li>One onion, chopped finely</li>
            <li>Celery with leaves, chopped fine</li>
            <li>One carrot, chopped fine</li>
            <li>Two cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Three tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>Four tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>One cup of dry white wine or white vermouth</li>
            <li>About two cups of meat broth</li>
            <li>Three tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
            <li>Six anchovy fillets, mashed</li>
            <li>Half a teaspoon of dried thyme</li>
            <li>Two to three bay leaves</li>
            <li>Two strips of lemon peel</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Fresh ground pepper</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>Tie the shanks around the middle with kitchen twine; this will keep them from falling apart during cooking.</li>
            <li>Chjoose a heavy, covered roasting pan which will just accommodate the veal shanks in one layer. Put the butter, two tablespoons of the oil, the onions, celery and carrots in the pan and sweat over medium heat until the vegetables have wilted--about eight minutes. Add the garlic and lemon peel and sweat until they're fragrant, about two minutes more. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a skiller until it is near the smoking point. Lightly flour the veal shanks and slip them into the oil. Richly brown the shanks on both of the cut sides, then place them in the roasting pan on top of the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Place the wine in the skilet and boil until reduced buy one-half, deglazing the bottom of the pan. Pour this over the veal shanks.</li>
            <li>Heat the beef broth to a boil in the skillet, whisking in the tomato paste and anchovies. Add this to the veal shanks, along with the herbs, several grindings of pepper, and a large pinch of salt. The liquid should cover three quarters of the shanks. If not, add extra water.</li>
            <li>Bring the pot to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for approximately two hours, turning and basting the shanks every half-hour. If you notice that the cooking liquids have nearly evaporated, add hot water, about one half cup at a time. The veal is done when it is fork tender and falling from the bone.</li>
            <li>Transfer the shanks to a platter, remove the strings, and cover to keep warm. If the sauce seems watery, as is probable, place the pan on the stove top over high heat and reduce the cooking liquid until the sauce has a thick, creamy consistency. Pour the sauce over the shanks and serve.</li>
        </ol>
