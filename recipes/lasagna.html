        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragu, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano, and basil.</p>
        <p>The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resuling baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
